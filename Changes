2.0.1  Wed Mar 17 11:10:54 PDT 2010
  Fixes
  * Quick fix to handle not always having Time::y2038.


2.0.0  Tue Mar 16 23:34:22 PDT 2010
  Incompatible Changes
  * In general, methods which return a list return an array in
    list context and an array ref in scalar context.  This enables
    chaining of autoboxed methods.
  * $module->load() is now $module->require() with simpler semantics.
    [github 107] [schwern]
  * Indirect object syntax (ie. $obj = new Class) is now a compile time
    syntax error.
  * $thing->mo now always returns a meta instance object.  This allows
    the meta object to DWIM on plain strings which previously would be
    treated as classes and return the meta class object.
  * The guaranteed range of gm/localtime() has been reduced to avoid
    depending on Time::y2038 if possible.
  * $thing->perl is now $thing->mo->perl and works on everything.

  New Features
  * $thing->mo->is_equal($other) universal equality method. [brunov]
  * $thing->mc has been added to always return a meta class object.
    This allows disambiguation when $thing could be considered a
    class name.
  * new autoboxed methods: %hash->diff() and %hash->intersect() [brunov]
  * Added $thing->mo->dump to dump objects in multiple formats
    including YAML and JSON.

  Fixes
  * Update dep on autovivification to one that works on 5.11 [schwern]
  * Update autobox::Core dep to clarify scalar vs list context returns.
  * Fix taint test failing with Test::More 0.95_01. [schwern]
  * Fix time compat test failing because of unknown time zones. [schwern]
  * Time::y2038 is only required if the built in time functions
    are not up to task. [schwern]

  Optimizations
  * Optimize @array->intersect() and @array->diff() when @array contains no refs.
    [brunov]


1.1.0  Tue Mar  2 19:09:49 PST 2010
  New Features
  * print() and say() now work on hashes, time(), localtime() and gmtime().
  * $obj->mo->checksum will return a checksum for the contents of any object.
  * Added $path->path2module and $module->module2path

  Bugs
  * alias() was still being exported.
  * Work around DateTime::TimeZone not being able to determine the local
    time zone on FreeBSD and possibly others.
  * localtime() is less suseptable to the DateTime distant year DOS attack.

  Docs
  * Document that carp() and croak() are exported.


1.0.0  Thu Feb 25 21:56:47 PST 2010
  New Features
  * @array->first() now takes a regex like @array->grep() [github 93] (brunov)
  * All autoboxed objects now respond to is_number() and friends.  They
    always return false. [github 100] (brunov)
  * All applicable array and hash methods now return arrays in list context
    and array refs in scalar context. (brunov)
  * diff() now works on nested data structures and honors overloaded objects
    (brunov)
  * Add a basic $number->round() [github 95]
  * Added @array->intersect() (brunov)

  Docs
  * Wrote perl5ifaq for all your frequently asked questions.
  * Document the perl5i command line utility. [github 31]

  Bug Fixes
  * Ensure the DateTime objects coming from time(), gmtime() and localtime()
    compare with eq and ==


0.2.2  Fri Feb 19 14:56:36 PST 2010
  Other
  * Some modules got the wrong version.


0.2.1  Fri Feb 19 04:23:58 PST 2010
  Bug Fixes
  * round_up() and round_down() didn't work


0.2.0  Fri Feb 19 03:48:36 PST 2010
  Incompatible Changes
  * "use perl5i" no longer works.  You must instead "use perl5i::0" to
    protect against future incompatibilities.  "use perl5i::latest" for
    the adventurous.
  * We no longer export rreturn() or lnoreturn() from Want.
    This can wait if we tackle lvalue subroutines.
  * load() is now a scalar method, so its $module->load not load($module)
  * alias() is now an autoboxed method rather than a function.

  New Features
  * try/catch support via Try::Tiny (brunov)
  * caller() now returns an object via Perl6::Caller (schwern, Timothy Totten)
  * Everything has a Meta object (perl5i::Meta) accessable via $thing->mo
  * Added meta object methods to handle tainting.
    mo->is_tainted(), mo->taint(), mo->untaint().
  * Added mo->reftype to get the bare reference type of anything.
  * Added mo->class to get the class of anything.
  * Added mo->ISA to return @ISA.
  * Added mo->super to call a method in a super class.
  * Added mo->linear_isa to get the object's inheritance path.
  * Introduced perl5i::latest to use the latest version.
  * Added %hash->flip() and %hash->merge() (brunov)
  * @array->grep now takes a regex
  * Select methods from List::MoreUtils added as ARRAY methods.
    all, any, none, true, false, uniq, minmax, mesh.
  * Added @array->diff() (brunov)
  * "use utf8" is on by default.
  * STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR and all opened filehandles have utf8 encoding on.
  * @ARGV is encoded as UTF8
  * Added methods to determine if a scalar is a number and what kind it
    is.
  * Added ceil()/floor() and round_up()/round_down() synonyms.

  Docs
  * Various POD fixes (chromatic, Richard Soderberg)
  * Collected together the autoboxed methods

  Other
  * Look, a changes document!
  * Added a patching policy.  See the PATCHING file.
  * We have a mailing list now.  http://groups.google.com/group/perl5i


0.1.0  Sat Jan 23 14:55:52 2010 -0800
  * Return to CPAN after deleting 20090424
  * New versioning scheme so we can declare incompatibilities, see
    semver.org for details.  If you have perl5i installed you must
    force an upgrade.
  * Thanks to the Open Source Bridge perl5i Hackathon!
