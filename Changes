  Bug Fixes

0.2.0  Fri Feb 19 03:48:36 PST 2010
  Incompatible Changes
  * "use perl5i" no longer works.  You must instead "use perl5i::0" to
    protect against future incompatibilities.  "use perl5i::latest" for
    the adventurous.
  * We no longer export rreturn() or lnoreturn() from Want.
    This can wait if we tackle lvalue subroutines.
  * load() is now a scalar method, so its $module->load not load($module)
  * alias() is now an autoboxed method rather than a function.

  New Features
  * try/catch support via Try::Tiny (brunov)
  * caller() now returns an object via Perl6::Caller (schwern, Timothy Totten)
  * Everything has a Meta object (perl5i::Meta) accessable via $thing->mo
  * Added meta object methods to handle tainting.
    mo->is_tainted(), mo->taint(), mo->untaint().
  * Added mo->reftype to get the bare reference type of anything.
  * Added mo->class to get the class of anything.
  * Added mo->ISA to return @ISA.
  * Added mo->super to call a method in a super class.
  * Added mo->linear_isa to get the object's inheritance path.
  * Introduced perl5i::latest to use the latest version.
  * Added %hash->flip() and %hash->merge() (brunov)
  * @array->grep now takes a regex
  * Select methods from List::MoreUtils added as ARRAY methods.
    all, any, none, true, false, uniq, minmax, mesh.
  * Added @array->diff() (brunov)
  * "use utf8" is on by default.
  * STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR and all opened filehandles have utf8 encoding on.
  * @ARGV is encoded as UTF8
  * Added methods to determine if a scalar is a number and what kind it
    is.
  * Added ceil()/floor() and round_up()/round_down() synonyms.

  Docs
  * Various POD fixes (chromatic, Richard Soderberg)
  * Collected together the autoboxed methods

0.1.0  Sat Jan 23 14:55:52 2010 -0800
  * Return to CPAN after deleting 20090424
  * New versioning scheme so we can declare incompatibilities, see
    semver.org for details.  If you have perl5i installed you must
    force an upgrade.
  * Thanks to the Open Source Bridge perl5i Hackathon!
