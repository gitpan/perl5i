Perl5i is my imaginary version of Perl 5.

The goal will be to load just one module and fix as much of Perl 5
as possible.

Since a lot of fixing Perl 5 is "go use this module from CPAN... and this
one... and this other one... and these two... and this and this..."
this mostly involves loading a bunch of modules.

What's Perl 5 look like in your imagination?
